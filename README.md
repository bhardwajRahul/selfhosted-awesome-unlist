## Why

The [Selfhosted Awesome List]() is indeed awesome, but like all lists becomes less and less useful as it's size increases. [Un]list solves some of these problems:

 - **awesome or not?** when looking at entries you need an indication of whether a project is still active, well supported, and beloved by it's community. [Un]list shows you stars, issues, and last updated information.
 - **spoon or fork?** many entries on the list defy categorisation. One project might belong in multiple categories, or maybe requires a category of it's own. [Un]list uses tags which solve this problem. Presently it just auto generates a few simple tags, but this feature is really going to depend on user contributed tags.
 - **all the sauce!** readme's / overviews all in one place in a neat, tidy, concise format
 - **searchable!** ok, I'm still working on this, but it's gonna be great!

## Help Wanted

_tags_

One of the main objectives I had in creating this repo was to organise projects with tags. When the projects are scraped, some simple tags are included like the category from the Selfhosted Awesome List, and whatever language github thinks the project is built with. Of course, there's a long way to go with this and the only solution is user contributed tags. You can fork the repository and add tags to the files in `/projects`. If that seems like too much trouble then just post an issue and I'll update the project for you.

_overviews & readmes_

In an effort to keep things simple, readmes are only scraped from projects with github urls, so we're not scraping text from project websites. This can be solved by either adding a github url, or by creating an overview (by copying & pasting some relevant info?). Again, these changes can be made to the files in `/projects`, or just post an issue if you're more comfortable with that. The [No Repo](/tags/no-repo.html) tag provides a list of projects with no specified repository.

_ui_

Clearly, beautiful UI's aren't my thing. If you have the magical ability to make things look great, then it would be great to have your help.
